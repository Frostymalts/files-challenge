		<p>Created by Marvel, Iron Man is the epitome of bad ass. He is worth crazy money, and just does not care…. at least on the outside. Tony Stark, the man inside the suite, is a brilliant engineer whose company’s profits keep the suites coming. He is definitely one of my favorite heroes, and RDJ does a great job portraying him in the movies. /fanboy <a href="http://marvel.com/characters/29/iron_man">Read More</a></p>
		<p>Iron Man has been in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man">comic, books, novels, and movies!</a> Although my favorite is the 2008 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film)">movie.</a></p>
