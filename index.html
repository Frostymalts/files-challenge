		<p>Iron Man is a fictional comic book superhero that appears in books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Tony Stark, the man inside the suite, suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. During his confinement he creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. He later uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Through his corporation, Stark Industries, Stark has created many military weapons, some of which, along with other technological devices of his making, have been integrated into his suit, helping him fight crime. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and business in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War themes to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.</p>
		<p>Iron Man has been in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man">comic, books, novels, and movies!</a></p>
